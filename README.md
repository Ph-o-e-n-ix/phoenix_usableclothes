# phoenix_usableclothes

Hey Guys, today im releasing a little Script for ESX called "Usable Clothes". You can setup Items to use them to change Outfits. Its very easy to use and you also have some more options in the Config (a.e Save outfits in database, custom animation...). If you guys have any Suggestions or just want to leave some Feedback, feel free to join my Discord. I hope you Guys like it.
